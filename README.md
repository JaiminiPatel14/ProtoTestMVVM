- **MVVMNetwork Layer**: Async/await based network service with structured error handling
- **Coordinators**: Manage navigation flow and decouple routing logic from views
- **Closures**: Used for communication between ViewModels and ViewController
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for core business logic and networking
